Welcome to my digital garden for personal & family topics.

Tags
#anytime - do anytime

- Guides (Coming Soon)
	- Guides highlight a particular pathway through this body of connected notes.
	- Some are simple outlines; others are essays I've written.

- Projects 
	- Multi-step, multidisciplinary things I'm working on. 

- Areas 
	- Current topics that help me complete projects.
	- Areas of my life that are relevant for a long time (a few months, a few years, up to a lifetime)

- Resources
	- Notes & sources that relate to a current Area or help me to complete a Project.

- Clippings
	- Clippings are also Resources. They are taken directly from the web using a Chrome extension. Word for word, images and all.

- Daily Notes
	- Informal, unpolished ideas
	- The title is the date it was created
