That’s a great instinct—Joe is essentially asking you to _lead yourself_ into the room, even before you arrive. SMBash is less about having credentials and more about whether you can **think like an owner**, **communicate clearly**, and **execute with integrity**. With 95 days, you have _plenty_ of runway.

  

Below is a **clear, non-fluffy framework** you can work through. I’ll organize it into **background knowledge**, **skills**, **mindset**, and **character qualities**, and then end with a **95-day preparation arc** so this feels actionable rather than overwhelming.

---

## **1. Background Knowledge to Build (What You Should Understand)**

  

You do _not_ need an MBA. You _do_ need fluency in the language of small business.

  

### **A. Core Small Business Literacy**

  

You should be able to explain these in plain English:

- **How businesses make money**
    
    - Revenue vs. profit
        
    - Fixed vs. variable costs
        
    - Cash flow (especially why profitable businesses still fail)
        
    
- **Basic financial statements**
    
    - Income statement (P&L)
        
    - Balance sheet (at a high level)
        
    - Cash flow statement (conceptual understanding)
        
    
- **Pricing**
    
    - Cost-based vs. value-based pricing
        
    - Why underpricing is a moral and strategic failure
        
    
- **Taxes (conceptual, not technical)**
    
    - Why you set aside money
        
    - Difference between personal and business finances
        
    

  

📌 _Goal:_ You should be able to follow a business conversation at SMBash without feeling lost.

---

### **B. Entrepreneurship & Ownership Concepts**

- Difference between:
    
    - **Employee mindset vs. owner mindset**
        
    - **Hobby business vs. scalable business**
        
    
- The idea of:
    
    - **Systems over hustle**
        
    - **Delegation and leverage**
        
    
- Basic legal structures:
    
    - Sole proprietor vs. LLC vs. S-Corp (high level only)
        
    

  

📌 _Goal:_ You sound thoughtful, not naive, when you ask questions.

---

### **C. SMBash-Specific Awareness**

  

Without over-researching:

- Why SMBash exists
    
- Who typically attends (operators, not dreamers)
    
- Why relationships > pitches
    

  

📌 _Goal:_ You show up understanding _why the room matters_.

---

## **2. Skills to Actively Practice (What You Should Be Able to Do)**

  

These matter more than raw knowledge.

  

### **A. Communication Skills (Critical)**

  

You should be able to:

- Introduce yourself confidently in **30 seconds**
    
    - Who you are
        
    - What you’re learning/building
        
    - Why you’re there
        
    
- Ask **good questions**
    
    - “What problem does your business solve?”
        
    - “What was hardest in your first year?”
        
    
- Listen without trying to impress
    

  

📌 _SMBash favors clarity over charisma._

---

### **B. Strategic Thinking**

  

Practice thinking in terms of:

- Problems → systems → solutions
    
- Long-term vs. short-term tradeoffs
    
- Risk vs. recklessness
    

  

A simple test:

  

> Can you look at a business and say, “If X fails, the whole thing collapses”?

---

### **C. Self-Management & Follow-Through**

  

Joe wants initiative—this is where you show it.

  

You should practice:

- Setting a plan and sticking to it
    
- Tracking progress weekly
    
- Finishing what you start
    
- Taking notes and synthesizing insights
    

  

📌 _Entrepreneurs trust people who execute small things well._

---

## **3. Mindset to Cultivate (How You Should Think)**

  

This is where most people fail.

  

### **A. Beginner’s Humility + Adult Responsibility**

  

Hold both at once:

- “I don’t know much yet”
    
- “I am fully responsible for learning”
    

  

Avoid:

- Impostor syndrome
    
- Overconfidence
    
- Needing validation
    

---

### **B. Long-Term Thinking**

  

At SMBash:

- You are **not there to “find the perfect idea”**
    
- You _are_ there to:
    
    - Learn how operators think
        
    - Observe patterns
        
    - Build trust
        
    

  

Think in **years**, not wins.

---

### **C. Ownership Mentality**

  

Practice saying (internally):

- “If this fails, it’s on me.”
    
- “No one is coming to rescue this.”
    

  

This mindset is magnetic in entrepreneurial spaces.

---

## **4. Character Qualities to Strengthen (Who You’re Becoming)**

  

These matter more than IQ.

  

### **A. Coachability**

- Can you receive correction without defensiveness?
    
- Can you say, “That makes sense—I hadn’t considered that”?
    

---

### **B. Integrity**

- Say what you mean
    
- Don’t exaggerate experience
    
- Follow through on commitments, even small ones
    

  

📌 People remember _consistency_ more than brilliance.

---

### **C. Courage**

- Willingness to ask questions
    
- Willingness to be seen as new
    
- Willingness to start before you feel ready
    

---

### **D. Partnership Maturity (Especially Important Since Joe Is Both)**

  

You should actively work on:

- Clear communication
    
- Separating ego from feedback
    
- Respecting complementary strengths
    

  

Ask yourself:

  

> “Am I making Joe’s life easier—or harder—by how I prepare?”

---

## **5. A Simple 95-Day Preparation Arc**

  

Here’s a clean way to approach the time.

  

### **Days 1–30: Foundation**

- Learn basic business concepts (finance, ownership, systems)
    
- Start a **business notebook**
    
- Practice explaining business ideas out loud
    
- Identify 3–5 industries you’re curious about
    

---

### **Days 31–60: Application**

- Analyze real businesses (local or online)
    
- Practice introductions and conversations
    
- Start thinking in terms of:
    
    - Problems
        
    - Customers
        
    - Solutions
        
    
- Have intentional weekly conversations with Joe about what you’re learning
    

---

### **Days 61–95: Integration & Confidence**

- Refine your personal “why I’m here” story
    
- Prepare thoughtful questions for SMBash
    
- Work on calm, grounded presence
    
- Focus on becoming **reliable**, not impressive
    

---

## **Final Reframe (This Is Important)**

  

You are not preparing to “prove yourself.”

You are preparing to **enter a room as someone who belongs there**—because you’ve done the internal work.

  

If you’d like, next we can:

- Build a **weekly 95-day plan**
    
- Craft your **SMBash introduction**
    
- Clarify what _role_ you might naturally play in a future business with Joe
    
- Identify what _not_ to worry about at all
    

  

Just tell me where you want to go next.
