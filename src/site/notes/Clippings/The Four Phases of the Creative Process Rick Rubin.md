You and I have talked about Rick Rubin's book, *The Creative Act*, before. Over the course of the book, he describes four phases of the creative process: Seed, Experimentation, Crafting, and Completion. Use these four phases to clarify your own creative process.

**The Seed Phase**.

Throughout the book, Rubin talks about creative ideas as “seeds.” In this phase, you collect as many potential ideas as possible.

“We can call this the Seed phase. We’re searching for potential starting points that, with love and care, can grow into something beautiful. At this stage, we are not comparing them to find the best seed. We simply gather them.” (143)

A seed can be any creative scrap or ember: a melodic phrase, a groove, a sentence or collection of words, a structure or a shape.

To catch a fish, cast a line in the water and wait attentively. “An artist casts a line to the universe.” (144) There is no judgment in this phase, just a sensitive gathering.

**The Experimentation Phase**

Once seeds have been gathered, an experimentation phase begins. To experiment means to try different versions, to engage in play and combination and connection without rules. Do the opposite of what comes naturally. Be open to surprise.

Which seeds should you give attention to? Choose the seeds that excite you to develop. “Excitement tends to be the best barometer for selecting which seeds to focus on. When something interesting starts to come together, it arouses delight. It’s an energizing feeling of wanting more. A feeling of leaning forward. Follow that energy.” (153)

“Allow the seed to follow its own path toward the sun. The time to discriminate will come later. For now, allow space for magic to enter.” (151–152)

**The Crafting Phase**

“Once the seed’s code has been cracked, and its true form deciphered, the process shifts. We are no longer in the unbounded mode of discovery. A clear sense of direction has arisen. Often unbeknownst to us, we find ourselves in the Craft phase. Now comes the labor of building.” (163)

Whereas in the seed and experimentation phases we largely let nature take its course and remain sensitive to the growth, in the craft phase, “we are bringing ourselves to the project to see what we can offer.” If what we add is not as promising as we thought it would be, we return to the beginning of the craft phase and take a different approach. This can also be where collaborators enter into the picture—a music producer, a skilled scene writer, session musicians, actors.

Rubin says that it can be difficult, but try to resist the temptation to revert back to the experiment phase too often. The craft phase is in many ways the most challenging, because it involves the most labor. “It’s helpful to think of it as another form of play…. There is a natural joy and sense of accomplishment in following a set of instructions to create something physical and beautiful.” (167)

Above all, be sensitive to momentum during the craft phase. Don’t let this phase extend too long or the work will become stale.

**The Completion Phase**

Think of the Completion phase as a refinement phase. You have developed the seed to its full potential through experiment and craft, and now the focus is on bringing the work to its final form so it can be released to the world.

It can be helpful to work with a deadline, and this is the time to seek feedback from others. “The primary aim,” Rubin explains, “is not to receive notes or opinions…. The intention is for you to experience the work anew.” (192) To hear it with new ears, see it with new eyes, experience it with new emotions.

There will come a time for deliberation to end, and for you to send your “memento of spirit” (196) into the world.

“When you and the work are in sync, there’s a time to put it out and move on.”

In each phase, let your sense of energy and excitement guide you. Energy, Rubin advises, leads you to this seed or that, to choose this or that experiment to craft and complete. Always be sensitive to where your creative energy takes you.

With these four phases, you can avoid a sense of aimlessness and approach your creative work with awareness, sensitivity, and when needed, disciplined craft and decisiveness.
